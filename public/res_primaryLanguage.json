I am an Air Force Veteran who was able to transition my knowledge into many different fields. Now I am transitioning all my past experiences into Software Development. The discipline, attention to detail, and strive for learning are all habits I have been able to transfer into the software field. I am most interested in developing applications that help us with productivity. Time for humans is our most valuable commodity. Being able to give more `time` to all, is what I strive for.",
